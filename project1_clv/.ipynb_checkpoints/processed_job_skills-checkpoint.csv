Join a team where your work will inspire millions to create and collaborate. Be part of a global movement that turns musical dreams into reality About The Role We're looking for a Data Scientist to help take our product and analytics capabilities to the next level. You'll join a lean, cross-functional data team where you'll work across the full stack, from deep user analysis, KPI development, and A/B testing to building ranking models that power personalized user experiences. Our team includes experienced ML and BI Engineers and Analysts, and reports directly to the Director of Data. We're collaborative, fast-moving, and deeply connected to the product: we're responsible for everything from executive reporting to developing machine learning models that improve user engagement and satisfaction. You'll operate across this full stack, supporting product discovery through deep user and business analysis, helping define and test success through experimentation, and building embedding-based retrieval, re-ranking, and recommendation systems. This role is ideal for someone who thrives at the intersection of data science, product thinking, and engineering: someone who is excited to drive impact from prototype to production.

We are building the fastest growing platform for AI builders with over 5 million users & 100k organizations who collectively shared over 1M models, 300k datasets & 300k apps. Our open-source libraries have more than 400k+ stars on Github. About the Role Hugging Face maintains a large collection of open source machine learning libraries, including transformers, diffusers, and datasets, just to name a few. However, these are all implemented in Python, meaning they aren't as easily accessible to JavaScript/TypeScript developers. So, in order to grow the Hugging Face ecosystem, we decided to build projects like transformers.js and huggingface.js with the primary goal of bridging the gap between web development and machine learning. WebML (Web Machine Learning) unlocks a range of new possibilities for building web applications by enabling models to run locally in the browser. Combining on-device machine learning with the plethora of APIs that browsers provide, empowers developers to create low-latency, interactive, and privacy-focused applications that can scale and reach users without them needing to install anything! This role operates at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and open-source community building. The focus will be to expand the Hugging Face ecosystem to web developers through the creation and maintenance of easy-to-use JS/TS machine learning libraries. About You We're looking for candidates with experience in the following aspects of web machine learning: Open source community management: issue tracking, PR review, etc. ONNX, quantization: converting and optimizing models for in-browser inference Experience with tools like optimum, torch dynamo, onnxscript, onnxruntime-genai are all positives Web technologies like WebGPU, WebNN, WASM: to enable running models in-browser at near-native speeds JavaScript/web experience: e.g., building demo applications to showcase new features If you're interested in joining us, but don't tick every box above, we still encourage you to apply! We're building a diverse team whose skills, experiences, and background complement one another. We're happy to consider where you might be able to make the biggest impact. More about Hugging Face We are actively working to build a culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusivity. We are intentionally building a workplace where people feel respected and supported—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We believe this is foundational to building a great company and community. Hugging Face is an equal opportunity employer and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We value development. You will work with some of the smartest people in our industry. We are an organization that has a bias for impact and is always challenging ourselves to continuously grow. We provide all employees with reimbursement for relevant conferences, training, and education. We care about your well-being. We offer flexible working hours and remote options. We support our employees wherever they are. While we have office spaces around the world, especially in the US, Canada, and Europe, we're very distributed and all remote employees have the opportunity to visit our offices.

WebML (Web Machine Learning) unlocks a range of new possibilities for building web applications by enabling models to run locally in the browser. Combining on-device machine learning with the plethora of APIs that browsers provide, empowers developers to create low-latency, interactive, and privacy-focused applications that can scale and reach users without them needing to install anything! This role operates at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and open-source community building. The focus will be to expand the Hugging Face ecosystem to web developers through the creation and maintenance of easy-to-use JS/TS machine learning libraries. About You We're looking for candidates with experience in the following aspects of web machine learning: Open source community management: issue tracking, PR review, etc. ONNX, quantization: converting and optimizing models for in-browser inference Experience with tools like optimum, torch dynamo, onnxscript, onnxruntime-genai are all positives Web technologies like WebGPU, WebNN, WASM: to enable running models in-browser at near-native speeds JavaScript/web experience: e.g., building demo applications to showcase new features If you're interested in joining us, but don't tick every box above, we still encourage you to apply! We're building a diverse team whose skills, experiences, and background complement one another. We're happy to consider where you might be able to make the biggest impact.

We are building the fastest growing platform for AI builders with over 5 million users & 100k organizations who collectively shared over 1M models, 300k datasets & 300k apps. Our open-source libraries have more than 400k+ stars on Github. About the Role Hugging Face maintains a large collection of open source machine learning libraries, including transformers, diffusers, and datasets, just to name a few. However, these are all implemented in Python, meaning they aren't as easily accessible to JavaScript/TypeScript developers. So, in order to grow the Hugging Face ecosystem, we decided to build projects like transformers.js and huggingface.js with the primary goal of bridging the gap between web development and machine learning. WebML (Web Machine Learning) unlocks a range of new possibilities for building web applications by enabling models to run locally in the browser. Combining on-device machine learning with the plethora of APIs that browsers provide, empowers developers to create low-latency, interactive, and privacy-focused applications that can scale and reach users without them needing to install anything! This role operates at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and open-source community building. The focus will be to expand the Hugging Face ecosystem to web developers through the creation and maintenance of easy-to-use JS/TS machine learning libraries. About You We're looking for candidates with experience in the following aspects of web machine learning: Open source community management: issue tracking, PR review, etc. ONNX, quantization: converting and optimizing models for in-browser inference Experience with tools like optimum, torch dynamo, onnxscript, onnxruntime-genai are all positives Web technologies like WebGPU, WebNN, WASM: to enable running models in-browser at near-native speeds JavaScript/web experience: e.g., building demo applications to showcase new features If you're interested in joining us, but don't tick every box above, we still encourage you to apply! We're building a diverse team whose skills, experiences, and background complement one another. We're happy to consider where you might be able to make the biggest impact. More about Hugging Face We are actively working to build a culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusivity. We are intentionally building a workplace where people feel respected and supported—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We believe this is foundational to building a great company and community.
